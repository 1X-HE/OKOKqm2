Project Overview

This project investigates the spatial externalities of short-term rentals on neighborhood safety. Focusing on London, 
we analyze the correlation between short-term rental proliferation and borough-level crime rates to test theories of Social Disorganization and Routine Activity.

1. Objectives
Research Question To what extent does the spatial density of active Airbnb listings correlate with recorded crime rates across London’s 32 Boroughs?

Key Hypotheses

The Density Effect: Higher density of active Airbnb listings is significantly associated with higher crime rates due to weakened community cohesion and increased transient populations.

The Seasonality Effect: Crime rates in boroughs with high tourist intensity exhibit distinct seasonal peaks (specifically May-August) compared to residential areas.

2. Data Collection & Preparation
Sources

Listings Data: InsideAirbnb (London Snapshot, 2024).

Crime Statistics: Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) - Reported offenses.

Demographics: Office for National Statistics (ONS) - Borough population data.

Scope

Timeframe: 24-month historical crime data aligned with 2024 listing snapshots.

Geographic Focus: London’s 32 Boroughs (excluding City of London due to population anomalies).

Data Cleaning: Removal of "ghost listings" (inactive properties) and outliers.

Derive Metrics

Airbnb Density: Calculated as active listings per 1,000 residents.

Crime Rate: Calculated as recorded offenses per 1,000 residents.

Commercialization Rate (New): Ratio of "Entire Home" listings, used to verify the guardianship structure.

Normalization: All metrics are normalized by population to ensure fair comparison across boroughs of varying sizes.

3. Visualisation

Time Series Plots

Display monthly crime trends over the 24-month period to identify seasonal fluctuations.

Highlight specific peaks during summer months (May-August) and holiday seasons (December).

Zone Comparisons

Stacked Bar Charts: Compare listing composition ("Entire Home" vs. "Private Room") between High and Low crime boroughs to test the "Guardianship" theory.

Scatter Plots: Plot Airbnb Density (X-axis) vs. Crime Rate (Y-axis) with a regression line to visualize the linear relationship.

Spatial Processing

Generate interactive Folium Heatmaps to visualize the spatial clustering of crime hotspots (e.g., Westminster, Camden) overlaid with Airbnb density distributions.

4. Analysis

Correlation and Proximity Analysis

Test the strength of the relationship between listing density and safety metrics.

Statistical Techniques: Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation.

Key Finding: A strong positive correlation was identified (Pearson r ≈ 0.87).


Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis 1: Does density significantly impact safety?

Test: OLS Regression and Significance Testing.

H0 (Null): There is no correlation between Airbnb density and crime rates.

H1 (Alternative): There is a significant correlation between Airbnb density and crime rates.

Outcome: The Null Hypothesis was rejected ($p < 0.05$). Further stratification revealed that high-crime boroughs are dominated by "Entire Home" listings (>70%).

Hypothesis 2: Do crime rates follow seasonal tourism patterns?

Test: Time-series decomposition and monthly average comparison.

Outcome: Validated the "Tourist Effect" with visible spikes in theft and burglary incidents during high-tourism months.

Predictive Modeling (Exploratory) Note: Extension subject to time availability.

Build a regression model to predict crime hotspots based on listing growth and demographic features.

Features: Listing density, Host type (Entire home vs. Shared room), IMD (Deprivation Index), Seasonality.

Model Types: Linear Regression or Random Forest.
