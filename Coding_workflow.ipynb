        "This function is important to visualise the distribution of Airbnb density across boroughs. First, it reads the CSV file and checks for required columns. Then, it sorts the data by Airbnb density in descending order to highlight the boroughs with the highest density. A bar chart is created to display the density for each borough, with colour mapping for visual distinction. Value labels are added on top of each bar for precise reading. The chart is then formatted with labels, title, rotated x-axis ticks, and grid lines to enhance readability. Finally, the chart is saved as a high-resolution image and displayed.\n",

First, it reads the CSV file and validates the presence of required columns for analysis. The data is then cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. Linear regression is performed to model the relationship between Airbnb density (independent variable) and crime rates (dependent variable), with R-squared calculated to assess model fit. Statistical outliers are identified by calculating z-scores from regression residuals, with 2.5 standard deviations highlighting boroughs that deviate significantly from the overall trend. A comprehensive scatter plot is generated displaying all data points, the regression line, and highlighted outliers with annotations. The visualisation is enhanced with statistical annotations including the regression equation, correlation coefficient, and outlier count.\n",

First, it reads the CSV file and verifies that the required columns for analysis are present. The data is then cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. Both parametric (Pearson) and non-parametric (Spearman) correlation tests are performed to assess the relationship between Airbnb density and crime rates, with p-values calculated to test statistical significance. Detailed hypothesis testing results are printed, including null and alternative hypotheses, correlation coefficients, p-values, and their interpretation. Additional statistical analyses are conducted, including calculation of data characteristics, 95% confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient. Finally, a scatter plot is generated to visualise the relationship between the two variables, annotated with the correlation coefficient and p-value.\n",

First, it reads the comprehensive crime dataset containing 24 months of borough-level data. The monthly columns are identified and extracted for analysis. The data is then aggregated by major crime type to calculate monthly averages across all boroughs, which are sorted in descending order to highlight the most prevalent crime categories. This initial analysis produces a ranking of crime types by their average monthly frequency. Subsequently, the function performs geographic hotspot analysis by calculating total incident counts for each crime type within each borough, then identifying which borough has the highest number of incidents for each crime category. These two analyses are merged to create an enhanced dataset that shows both the average monthly frequency of each crime type and the borough where that crime type is most concentrated. Finally, the results are saved to CSV files for further analysis, and a bar chart is generated to visualize the distribution of crime types by monthly average frequency.\n",

First, it loads and prepares the crime dataset, extracting monthly time-series data for analysis. The function calculates monthly averages by crime type to identify the most prevalent criminal activities across London, then identifies geographic hotspots by determining which borough has the highest incidence for each crime type. Following this general analysis, the function conducts targeted investigation of specific crime types (THEFT and BURGLARY) in selected boroughs (Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden, Sutton) to analyse localised trends. Time-series plots are generated for these specific analyses, with particular emphasis on highlighting patterns during May-August and December periods.\n",

        "This function is important to visualize crime hotspot patterns across London boroughs through interactive heatmaps. First, it reads the comprehensive crime dataset containing 24 months of borough-level crime statistics. The function analyzes crime type frequencies to identify the three most common crime categories and the least common category for focused analysis. For each selected crime type, the function aggregates total incidents across all time periods by borough. Using predefined geographic coordinates for each London borough, the code generates interactive heatmaps that visually represent crime concentration levels. The heatmaps utilize a colour gradient from blue (low incidence) to red (high incidence) to indicate crime density. Additional circular markers are placed on each borough with size and colour proportional to crime counts, and popups provide detailed statistics when clicked. A descriptive title overlay is added to each map showing the crime type and the borough with the highest incidence.\n",

First, both datasets are prepared by cleaning and filtering relevant boroughs, then merged to create a unified analysis dataset. Correlation analysis is performed to examine pairwise relationships between crime totals and deprivation indicators, visualised through a heatmap. Both univariate and multivariate regression analyses are conducted to quantify the impact of each deprivation domain on crime levels, with detailed statistical outputs including coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values. Multicollinearity is assessed using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to identify potential issues with correlated independent variables. The results are printed through comprehensive summary tables comparing univariate and multivariate findings, and scatter plots are generated to visualize the relationship between each deprivation indicator and crime totals.\n",
