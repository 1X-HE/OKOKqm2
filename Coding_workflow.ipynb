        "This function is important to visualise the distribution of Airbnb density across boroughs. First, it reads the CSV file and checks for required columns. Then, it sorts the data by Airbnb density in descending order to highlight the boroughs with the highest density. A bar chart is created to display the density for each borough, with colour mapping for visual distinction. Value labels are added on top of each bar for precise reading. The chart is then formatted with labels, title, rotated x-axis ticks, and grid lines to enhance readability. Finally, the chart is saved as a high-resolution image and displayed.\n",

First, it reads the CSV file and validates the presence of required columns for analysis. The data is then cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. Linear regression is performed to model the relationship between Airbnb density (independent variable) and crime rates (dependent variable), with R-squared calculated to assess model fit. Statistical outliers are identified by calculating z-scores from regression residuals, with 2.5 standard deviations highlighting boroughs that deviate significantly from the overall trend. A comprehensive scatter plot is generated displaying all data points, the regression line, and highlighted outliers with annotations. The visualisation is enhanced with statistical annotations including the regression equation, correlation coefficient, and outlier count.\n",

First, it reads the CSV file and verifies that the required columns for analysis are present. The data is then cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. Both parametric (Pearson) and non-parametric (Spearman) correlation tests are performed to assess the relationship between Airbnb density and crime rates, with p-values calculated to test statistical significance. Detailed hypothesis testing results are printed, including null and alternative hypotheses, correlation coefficients, p-values, and their interpretation. Additional statistical analyses are conducted, including calculation of data characteristics, 95% confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient. Finally, a scatter plot is generated to visualise the relationship between the two variables, annotated with the correlation coefficient and p-value.\n",

        "This function is important to analyse crime patterns across London boroughs by crime type and identify geographic hotspots. First, it reads the comprehensive crime dataset containing 24 months of borough-level data. The monthly columns are identified and extracted for analysis. The data is then aggregated by major crime type to calculate monthly averages across all boroughs, which are sorted in descending order to highlight the most prevalent crime categories. This initial analysis produces a ranking of crime types by their average monthly frequency. Subsequently, the function performs geographic hotspot analysis by calculating total incident counts for each crime type within each borough, then identifying which borough has the highest number of incidents for each crime category. These two analyses are merged to create an enhanced dataset that shows both the average monthly frequency of each crime type and the borough where that crime type is most concentrated. Finally, the results are saved to CSV files for further analysis, and a bar chart is generated to visualize the distribution of crime types by monthly average frequency.\n",

First, it loads and prepares the crime dataset, extracting monthly time-series data for analysis. The function calculates monthly averages by crime type to identify the most prevalent criminal activities across London, then identifies geographic hotspots by determining which borough has the highest incidence for each crime type. Following this general analysis, the function conducts targeted investigation of specific crime types (THEFT and BURGLARY) in selected boroughs (Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden, Sutton) to analyse localised trends. Time-series plots are generated for these specific analyses, with particular emphasis on highlighting patterns during May-August and December periods.\n",

        "This function is important to visualize crime hotspot patterns across London boroughs through interactive heatmaps. First, it reads the comprehensive crime dataset containing 24 months of borough-level crime statistics. The function analyzes crime type frequencies to identify the three most common crime categories and the least common category for focused analysis. For each selected crime type, the function aggregates total incidents across all time periods by borough. Using predefined geographic coordinates for each London borough, the code generates interactive heatmaps that visually represent crime concentration levels. The heatmaps utilize a colour gradient from blue (low incidence) to red (high incidence) to indicate crime density. Additional circular markers are placed on each borough with size and colour proportional to crime counts, and popups provide detailed statistics when clicked. A descriptive title overlay is added to each map showing the crime type and the borough with the highest incidence.\n",

        "\n",
        "In evaluating the link between Airbnb density and crime rates in London, the importance of neighbourhood socio‑economic context as a potential confounding factor has been recognised. The UK Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD 2019) offers a comprehensive and detailed theoretical framework for this purpose. However, its direct inclusion in the regression models of this study is subject to two key methodological constraints. First, the composite IMD index itself includes a “crime deprivation” domain. Introducing the overall IMD score as a control variable in a model where crime rate is the dependent variable would create serious endogeneity issues, leading to biased estimates. Second, the IMD data are released at the Lower‑layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level, whereas the key variables in this study—Airbnb density and others—are aggregated to the London borough level. Directly using the raw IMD data would thus introduce a mismatch in the scale of analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these limitations and to better disentangle the pathways through which different structural factors may influence crime rates, this study adopts the following strategy. We obtained average scores for each of the seven deprivation domains of the IMD. In the analysis, these domain scores are treated as separate covariates and tested individually in the models. This approach serves a dual purpose: first, it allows us to control for key socio‑economic dimensions such as income, employment, and education while avoiding the circular explanation that would arise from including a crime‑containing composite index; second, the method enables to show potentially distinct association patterns between different dimensions of social deprivation and crime rate.\n",
